Summary of Key Changes & Considerations:

    Pricing: Updated for all three tiers.

    Free Diagnostic: The "free breakdown for all those" is interpreted as the "Targeted Strategy Session" being the initial paid diagnostic deep-dive, while the "Premium Mastery Program" also explicitly includes a "Free Full Test Diagnostic Assessment" as a listed feature. If you offer a completely free (no charge) initial consultation before any package, that should be a separate call to action on the site (e.g., "Book a Free Consultation").

    Bonus Indicators: Added (+ BONUS) where requested. This can be implemented visually with an icon or distinct text styling.

    Target Audience: Clarified for Standard and Premium programs.

    Email/Text Support: Standardized to "Email & Text Support" for both Standard and Premium, without specific time restrictions mentioned.

    Materials for Premium: Changed to "Custom Strategy Materials" and "Priority in New Material Creation/Selection."

    Removed Features: Application Guidance Session from Premium.
