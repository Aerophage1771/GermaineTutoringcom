✅ STRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS

1. Rebalance the Layout

    Left Column: Shrink width, float over white background with subtle shadow or card outline. Consider merging “Account Summary” and “Session History” into a tabbed card (toggle between them).

    Right Section: Center-align the button list. Add spacing between buttons and move away from full-width look — go with 60–70% width or use two-column layout on wider screens.

2. Group & Label

    Add a section label or light divider lines:

        “Sessions & Tracking”

        “Practice & Review”

        “Resources & Tools”

🎨 VISUAL DESIGN

3. Color Palette

    Use a softer blue (#3B82F6 or #2563EB) instead of harsh navy.

    Use light gray background (#F9FAFB) with white cards for key UI elements.

    Accent with a primary action color (e.g. blue for session booking) and secondary text in muted gray.

4. Button Styling

    Add rounded corners (lg or xl radius).

    Use icons with lighter weight, spaced better from text.

    Hover effects: subtle background fill or shadow rather than stark color inversion.

5. Typography

    Make “Student Dashboard” lighter — reduce font weight or switch to a friendlier typeface.

    Add sub-labels under major buttons (e.g., “Book a new tutoring session” under Book Session).

    Use consistent font sizing and tracking.

🧠 INTERACTION IMPROVEMENTS

6. Animations

    Use micro-interactions: subtle fade, scale, or icon movement when buttons are hovered or clicked.

    Animate dropdowns (e.g., “Session History”) with a slide effect, not abrupt show/hide.

7. Mobile Responsiveness

    Stack buttons with slightly smaller font and spacing.

    Use a hamburger menu or collapsible side drawer for less critical options.

✨ ADDITIONAL POLISH

8. Personal Touch

    Display student’s first name (“Welcome back, Jordan!”).

    Add a profile icon/avatar in the top right with access to settings/logout.

9. Icon Refresh

    Swap current icons for a more modern set (e.g., from Lucide or Heroicons).

    Ensure consistent line thickness and visual weight.

10. Dark Mode Ready

    Use Tailwind-style class tokens or CSS variables that support automatic dark mode toggling if possible.
