Prompt for Redesign:

"Please redesign the layout of the provided 3-column informational display (currently showing 'DEFINE', 'DEMONSTRATE', 'DUPLICATE' with individual dropdowns).

The new design should feature:

    Single Drawer Mechanism:

        Remove the individual dropdown arrows currently associated with each of the 'DEFINE', 'DEMONSTRATE', and 'DUPLICATE' headers.

        The top row will consist of the 'DEFINE', 'DEMONSTRATE', and 'DUPLICATE' titles along with their brief introductory descriptions, presented side-by-side without individual expansion controls.

        Introduce a single, global expansion arrow (or similar control) positioned beneath this entire top strip (spanning across the width of all three initial headers).

        Activating this single arrow should reveal an expanded "drawer" section below it. This drawer will simultaneously display all the detailed content for 'The DEFINE Process', 'The DEMONSTRATE Process', and 'The DUPLICATE Process' side-by-side in their respective columns.

    Visual Alignment and Formatting Consistency within the Drawer:

        Align Example Boxes: When the drawer is open, ensure the 'Example' boxes within 'The DEFINE Process', 'The DEMONSTRATE Process', and 'The DUPLICATE Process' sections are horizontally aligned with each other (e.g., their top edges should align, or they should be centered relative to each other) to maximize visual clarity.

        Standardize Process Box Structure: Ensure the internal structure and formatting for each of the three main content boxes ('The DEFINE Process', 'The DEMONSTRATE Process', 'The DUPLICATE Process') are consistent. This includes:

            Uniform styling for the main titles (e.g., "The DEFINE Process:").

            Consistent styling and formatting for sub-headings (e.g., "Name it –", "Walkthrough –", "Guided repetition –"). Ensure these elements align across the columns where appropriate.

            Consistent formatting for the descriptive text following each sub-heading.

            Maintain clear visual separation and hierarchy within each process description.

The goal is to create a cleaner initial view with a single point of interaction to reveal the details, and then ensure the revealed details are presented in a highly organized, visually consistent, and aligned manner."
