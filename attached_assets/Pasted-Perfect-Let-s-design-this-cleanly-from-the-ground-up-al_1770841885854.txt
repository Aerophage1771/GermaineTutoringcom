Perfect. Let’s design this cleanly from the ground up, almost like we are creating a mini product inside your site.

I will break this into four parts exactly as you asked:

1. Purpose
2. Integration with the rest of your site
3. Proposed blog titles
4. Main hub copy draft

---

# PART 1 – PURPOSE

Before writing anything, we need to define what the roadmap hub is meant to accomplish.

### Core Mission Statement

The LSAT Beginner Roadmap exists to give new students a clear, step-by-step path from total confusion to confident, organized studying.

That mission breaks into five concrete purposes.

---

## A. Orientation

The hub should help a brand-new visitor answer:

* What is the LSAT really testing?
* How should I think about this exam?
* Where do I even begin?

Most beginners arrive overwhelmed. The hub reduces that anxiety immediately.

---

## B. Education Without Copyright Risk

Because you cannot reproduce LSAC questions, the hub provides value in safer ways:

* Teaching concepts
* Explaining processes
* Modeling reasoning
* Showing how to study

It lets you be helpful without relying on proprietary material.

---

## C. Organization of Your Content

Right now your blog will naturally grow into dozens of posts.

The hub acts as:

* A table of contents
* A suggested reading order
* A logical curriculum

It turns scattered articles into a structured course.

---

## D. Trust Building

Instead of random tips, the hub communicates:

This tutor has a real system.

It shows that your blog is not just advice, but a coherent method.

---

## E. Conversion

Finally, the hub gently leads readers toward tutoring when appropriate:

* After they understand the basics
* After they see the depth of your approach
* After they feel guided, not sold to

---

# PART 2 – INTEGRATION WITH THE SITE

The hub should function as a central crossroads between three parts of your ecosystem:

* Blog
* Tutoring programs
* Methodology page

Here is how it should connect.

---

## Navigation Placement

Ideally the hub gets a prominent place such as:

**LSAT Blog → Beginner Roadmap**

It should be the first item a new reader sees on the blog page.

---

## Internal Linking Strategy

Each section of the hub links to:

* Specific beginner-focused blog posts
* Key methodology pages
* Occasional tutoring calls to action

The flow should look like this:

Homepage → Blog → Roadmap Hub → Individual Articles → Consultation

---

## Relationship to Your About Page

The hub is not about you.

Your About page explains your story.
The hub explains the student journey.

Different jobs, complementary roles.

---

## Relationship to Tutoring Programs

The hub should never feel like a sales page.

However, at natural transition points, it can say:

If you want help applying this roadmap, here is how to work with me.

That is integration without pressure.

This is written to be practical, welcoming, and direct.

## LSAT Beginner Roadmap

### New to the LSAT? Start Here.

If you spend a few weeks following this sequence carefully, you will have a stronger starting point than most students who study on their own.
