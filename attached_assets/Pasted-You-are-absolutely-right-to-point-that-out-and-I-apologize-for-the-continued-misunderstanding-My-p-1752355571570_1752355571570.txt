You are absolutely right to point that out, and I apologize for the continued misunderstanding. My previous attempts still included markdown for lists (like bullet points and numbered lists) and indentation, which, while simple, are still forms of formatting.

When you say "plain text," you mean literally just the words, without any special characters for formatting, list markers, or extra indentation. I incorrectly interpreted "plain text" as "no rich text (like bold/italics/headers), but keep structural lists." My mistake.

Here is the content converted to what I now understand as true plain text – no bullets, no numbers, no extra indents, just raw lines of text:

COMMANDS:

On the “Learning Library” section, replace the existing tile with a full-page layout titled "LSAT Learning Library".

Below the title, add 5 large clickable cards, one for each main section:

Fundamental Skills
Logical Reasoning
Reading Comprehension
Writing Section
Strategies and Advanced Techniques

When a user clicks on a section card:

Open a new view showing a list of its subsections as clickable items.

When a user clicks on a subsection:

Open a separate window (e.g., a modal or new browser tab) containing a sample written content page.
Use the following sample content (summarized below) for each subsection.

Fundamental Skills – Sample Content

Intro to Grammar
Understand how sentence structure, punctuation, and clarity affect logical reasoning. LSAT questions assume precision in language.

Intro to Arguments
Learn how to identify premises and conclusions. Understand how arguments are structured and how roles support logic.

Conditional Logic
Master common logical indicators like “if,” “only if,” “unless.” Learn to form contrapositives and distinguish sufficiency from necessity.

Advanced Conditional Logic
Dive into chains of conditionals, nested structures, and exception cases.

Logic Flaws
Review frequent fallacies like circular reasoning, ad hominem, and equivocation. Understand how to spot flawed argumentation.

Causation
Learn to differentiate correlation from causation. Understand alternative explanations and counterfactuals.

Section 1: Argument Structure and Reasoning Types

Build a foundation by learning how arguments are constructed and how their parts function.

Main Conclusion
Find the statement that is supported by the others. Avoid confusing it with intermediate conclusions.

Argument Part
Classify parts of the stimulus: is it a premise, background, counterclaim, or conclusion?

Method of Reasoning
Describe how the argument is built. Is it analogical, conditional, or comparative?

Parallel Reasoning
Match the logical form of the argument across different topics.

Agree/Disagree
Contrast speaker positions. What do they actually agree or disagree on?

Section 2: Argument Flaws and Evaluation

Focus on weaknesses in reasoning and how to assess argument quality.

Flaw
Identify the logical weakness. Are assumptions unstated? Are causal leaps unjustified?

Parallel Flaw
Match flawed reasoning patterns, not just valid forms.

Evaluate
Choose the piece of info that would most strengthen or weaken the argument’s reasoning.

Section 3: Strengthening, Weakening, and Assumption Types

Reinforce or challenge arguments and understand the assumptions they rely on.

Weaken
Identify info that would undercut the argument’s support for its conclusion.

Strengthen
Identify info that would reinforce the link between premise and conclusion.

Principle–Rule
Match an abstract rule to the case given.

Principle–Application
Match the correct case to the abstract rule.

Sufficient Assumption
Identify a claim that, if added, guarantees the conclusion.

Necessary Assumption
Identify a claim that must be true for the conclusion to follow.

Section 4: Inference and Completion

Focus on what logically follows or completes an argument based on available information.

Fill in the Blank
Complete an argument logically based on surrounding context.

Most Strongly Supported
Identify the answer most supported by the provided info.

Must Be True
Deduce a conclusion that must follow from the stimulus.

Must Be False
Eliminate conclusions that contradict the stimulus.

Resolve / Reconcile / Explain
Clarify an apparent contradiction or puzzling result.

Reading Comprehension – Sample Content

Passage Types:

Informational – Just the facts; tone is neutral.
Presents a Debate – Two views; author's position may be unclear.
Argumentative – Clear opinion backed by reasoning.
Comparative – Two passages that must be contrasted and compared.

Question Types:

Main Point – Central thesis.
Detail – Specific fact mentioned.
Inference – What must be or is likely true.
Author’s Attitude – Tone and viewpoint.
Purpose – Why a sentence/paragraph exists.
Analogy – Similar situation or structure.
Organization / Function – Structure or purpose of content blocks.
Strengthen/Weaken (RC) – How new info impacts a passage’s claims.

Writing Section – Sample Content

Overview / Format – One dilemma; choose a side and justify it.
Structure & Timing – Intro, body paragraphs, conclusion. 35 minutes.
Balanced Argument – Acknowledge the other side respectfully.
Effective Response – Clear stance, logical flow, specific examples.
Common Mistakes – Vague claims, poor structure, lack of support.
Samples – Example of high-scoring vs low-scoring essays.

Strategies and Advanced Techniques – Sample Content

Reasonableness Standard – Think like a test writer; eliminate implausible options.
Inverting Stimulus/Answer – Flip the question: what must be false? What if X isn’t true?
Graded Removal – Eliminate answers in degrees from least to most wrong.
Assumption Comparison – Compare assumptions between choices, use negation test.
Pattern Recognition – Spot argument types quickly to anticipate question type.
Time Management – Segment your time per question and section.
Advanced Review – Use post-test reflection like “If I wrote the LSAT, how would I trick myself?”

Make sure:

Clicking a section card replaces the view with its subsection list.
Clicking a subsection opens a new window or modal with full sample content.
Only one window opens per click to keep the experience clean.
All section and subsection names are styled clearly and consistently. Use hover states or icons to indicate clickable items.

Let me know if you want the sample content turned into actual text templates per subsection!
