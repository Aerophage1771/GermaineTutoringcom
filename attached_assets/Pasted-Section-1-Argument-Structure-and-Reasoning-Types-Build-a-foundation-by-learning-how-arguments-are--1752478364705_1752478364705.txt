Section 1: Argument Structure and Reasoning Types

Build a foundation by learning how arguments are constructed and how their parts function.

    Main Conclusion
    Find the statement that is supported by the others. Avoid confusing it with intermediate conclusions.

    Argument Part
    Classify parts of the stimulus: is it a premise, background, counterclaim, or conclusion?

    Method of Reasoning
    Describe how the argument is built. Is it analogical, conditional, or comparative?

    Parallel Reasoning
    Match the logical form of the argument across different topics.

    Agree/Disagree
    Contrast speaker positions. What do they actually agree or disagree on?

Section 2: Argument Flaws and Evaluation

Focus on weaknesses in reasoning and how to assess argument quality.

    Flaw
    Identify the logical weakness. Are assumptions unstated? Are causal leaps unjustified?

    Parallel Flaw
    Match flawed reasoning patterns, not just valid forms.

    Evaluate
    Choose the piece of info that would most strengthen or weaken the argument’s reasoning.

Section 3: Strengthening, Weakening, and Assumption Types

Reinforce or challenge arguments and understand the assumptions they rely on.

    Weaken
    Identify info that would undercut the argument’s support for its conclusion.

    Strengthen
    Identify info that would reinforce the link between premise and conclusion.

    Principle–Rule
    Match an abstract rule to the case given.

    Principle–Application
    Match the correct case to the abstract rule.

    Sufficient Assumption
    Identify a claim that, if added, guarantees the conclusion.

    Necessary Assumption
    Identify a claim that must be true for the conclusion to follow.

Section 4: Inference and Completion

Focus on what logically follows or completes an argument based on available information.

    Fill in the Blank
    Complete an argument logically based on surrounding context.

    Most Strongly Supported
    Identify the answer most supported by the provided info.

    Must Be True
    Deduce a conclusion that must follow from the stimulus.

    Must Be False
    Eliminate conclusions that contradict the stimulus.

    Resolve / Reconcile / Explain
    Clarify an apparent contradiction or puzzling result.
