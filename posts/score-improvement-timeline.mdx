The two questions I get most often from high-scoring students looking to hit that 175+ range consistently is:

1.  "How do you finally get rid of those same mistakes that keep coming back?" AND
2.  "What do you do when every time you fix one mistake, it just results in another one showing up?"

Thankfully, those questions have a common answer. Here is the study process I used to get from -5 to -0 and the one that several of my students have used to land 99th percentile scores the last 5 years.

> **WARNING:** This is not the fastest or most efficient way to improve if you're crunched for time or not aiming for a -0. This process is intensive, demanding, and can be a grind. But it is also the most complete method I've found for those who are aiming for the absolute top tier of scores and are willing to spend time and energy to fundamentally understand their approach to the test. That's the trade off.

If you’re ready for that, here’s the breakdown:

## The Core Cycle

This is the repeatable loop you'll follow.

### Step 1: Take a Full-Length Timed Practice Test
- If at all possible, pick a day (or several hours) and dedicate it to the test. I recommend giving yourself enough time to at least start the blind review process later in the day.
- Save your timed answers but do not look at the correct answers.
- Take a real break afterward to reset your brain (like 30 minutes).

### Step 2: The COMPLETE Blind Review
This will take longer than the test itself so prepare to break it up. For every single question (you haven't checked the answers yet), you need to write out or talk through (and transcribe) your entire thought process:

- What is the question stem actually asking?
- What is the core information/argument in the stimulus?
- What is the main point/structure of the passage?
- What am I looking for in an answer?
- Why is the correct answer 100% correct?
- Why is every single incorrect answer 100% incorrect?

If you are less than 99% sure about the approach to or answer of a question, set a minimum 10-minute timer for it and dig in.

- **If you're stuck on the Stimulus/Passage:** Break it down sentence by sentence. Translate each statement into the simplest possible terms. Your goal should be to understand it so well you could explain it to a third grader. If you can't, that's your #1 priority. Consider diagramming if you’re still stuck (even informal diagramming for a passage/non-conditional stimulus).
- **If you're stuck between Answer Choices:**
    - Re-confirm the Stem: Are you sure you're not misreading it? Is there an "EXCEPT" you missed? Are you referring to the right speaker? Most Strongly Supports or Most Strongly Supported? Sufficient or Necessary Assumption?
    - Idealize: What would a perfect answer look like before you read the choices?
    - Direct Comparison: For two choices (A vs. C), literally cross out the parts that are the same. Break down the remaining differences. Which difference is more relevant to the question being asked?

Star your breakthroughs! Any question where you have an "aha!" moment is gold. Mark it for later.

### Step 3: Audit Against the Answer Key
Now, check your answers. For any question you missed (initially or in blind review), were less than 100% confident on, or just feel you could have done faster, you need to:

- Find an external explanation (7Sage, LSAT Hacks, r/LSAT, a tutor, etc.).
- Pinpoint exactly where your thought process went wrong compared to the optimal one.
- Explain your specific error. Don't just say "I messed up the contrapositive." Be more specific.
    - *Example of a specific error:* "The logic was 'If A, then B and C; if C, then D.' The correct contrapositive was 'not D -> not C -> not A'. I misinterpreted this and thought that 'not D' also allowed me to conclude 'not B', which it doesn’t."

### Step 4: Rule Creation (The Most Important Step!!)
This is how you prevent yourself from making the same mistake twice. Convert your errors and breakthroughs into actionable rules.

A **bad rule** is:
- *Vague:* "Apply contrapositives better." (When? How?)
- *Unactionable:* "Be careful when reading the stimulus." (What behavior does that communicate? Who's being careless on purpose?)

A **good rule** is specific and actionable, and ideally includes an example:
- **Rule:** "In a conditional chain like 'A -> B+C' and 'C -> D', the contrapositive does not allow you to negate a standalone element like B just because the chain is broken."
- **Concrete Example:** "If you are a New Yorker (A), you are a city dweller (B) AND on the East Coast (C). If you're on the East Coast (C), you're in North America (D). If we know John lives in Paris, we know he's not in North America (not D), so he's not on the East Coast (not C), and not a New Yorker (not A). But we CANNOT say he isn't a city dweller (B). He is."

### Step 5: Triage and Implement Your Rules
You can't keep 40 rules in your head. Pick 3-5 to focus on for your next PT. Prioritize them based on how often the issue comes up or how easy it is to fix.

## How to Avoid Burnout (Super Important!)

Doing this full, intensive review for every single PT can be brutal and do more harm than good if it kills the quality of your analysis over time. I usually recommend a three-test cycle:

- **Test 1:** Do the full, every-question deep-dive blind review described above.
- **Tests 2 & 3:** Do a partial blind review. Only do the deep dive on questions you're less than 90% sure on. Those will get you the most bang for your buck in terms of identifying errors to fix.
- **When to recalibrate:** If you find you're consistently missing questions on your "partial" review days that you thought you were 90% confident about, you may need to raise your internal standard for what that confidence level feels like to ensure you're not missing too many questions you should've Blind Reviewed.

And remember: in this score range, it's a marathon, not a sprint. Books and courses only get so specific and when you run out of content, you might see your score growth slow down. That's okay. The goal is to now build reliable, repeatable rules on top of that foundational skillset.

Happy to answer any questions in the comments. Good luck with the grind!
