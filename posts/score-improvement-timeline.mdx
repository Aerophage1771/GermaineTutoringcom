# How to Train Yourself to Hit –0 on LR and RC  
*(from a 180 Scorer)*

The two questions I hear most from students pushing for 175+ are:

1. **“How do I get rid of the same mistakes that keep coming back?”**  
2. **“Every time I fix one mistake, another pops up. What now?”**

Good news: both problems share a solution. Below is the exact cycle that took me from –5 to –0 and has helped multiple students land 99th-percentile scores.

> **Warning**  
> This is not fast or light. It is exhaustive and demanding. If you want the absolute top tier and have the time and grit, read on.

## The Core Cycle

### Step 1. Take a Full-Length Timed Practice Test

- Block off a chunk of the day so you can start blind review later.  
- Record your answers but do **not** check them yet.  
- Take a 30-minute reset break before moving on.

### Step 2. The *Complete* Blind Review

For **every** question—without peeking at answers—write or record:

- What is the question stem asking?  
- What is the core argument or information?  
- What am I looking for in an answer?  
- Why is the correct answer 100 % correct?  
- Why is each wrong answer 100 % wrong?

If your certainty is below 99 %, set a 10-minute timer and dig deeper.

**If stuck on the stimulus or passage**  
Break it down sentence by sentence. Translate into simple language. Diagram if needed.

**If stuck between answer choices**

1. Re-confirm the stem—did you miss an EXCEPT or mislabel suff-vs-nec assumption?  
2. Idealize the perfect answer before rereading choices.  
3. Directly compare contenders: cross out matching parts, scrutinize the difference.

Star every “aha!” moment for later.

### Step 3. Audit Against the Answer Key

Now check answers. For each miss, uncertainty, or slow solve:

1. Read an outside explanation (7Sage, LSAT Hacks, r/LSAT, tutor).  
2. Pinpoint exactly where your reasoning diverged from the optimal line.  
3. Describe your error with precision.

> **Bad**: “Messed up the contrapositive.”  
> **Good**: “Chain was A → B + C and C → D. I thought ¬D let me infer ¬B, which is invalid.” (PT-106-S-1-Q-20)

### Step 4. Create Rules (Most Important)

Convert mistakes or breakthroughs into **specific, actionable rules**.

- **Bad rule**: “Be careful reading stimuli.”  
- **Good rule**: “In chained conditionals, negating a link only negates elements downstream, not independent siblings.”

Include a concrete example for each rule.

### Step 5. Triage and Implement

You cannot juggle forty rules. Pick **three to five** for the next test—prioritize by frequency and fix-ability.

## Avoiding Burnout

Use a three-test rhythm:

1. **Test 1** – full deep-dive blind review.  
2. **Tests 2 & 3** – partial blind review; deep-dive only questions where confidence < 90 %.  

Recalibrate if you discover surprises in those “90 % sure” items.

Remember: at this level improvement is a marathon. Once you exhaust books and courses, growth slows. That is normal. The goal now is building a reliable, reusable rulebook on top of your fundamentals.

### Need a Hand?

If this sounds powerful—but exhausting—I get it. I can handle the analysis, pinpoint your patterns, and help craft the exact rules you need.

**Book a free 15-minute consultation at GermaineTutoring.com** and leave the first session knowing the rule that fixes your #1 recurring error.

Good luck with the grind—see you at –0.
