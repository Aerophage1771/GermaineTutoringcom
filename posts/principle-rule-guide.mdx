I've seen a lot of students lately get tripped up by a specific type of Logical Reasoning question: Principle Questions. They usually ask you to either (A) apply a given principle to a new situation or (B) find a principle that justifies an argument.

Today, I want to focus on the second type: the ones that ask you to find a rule that "justifies," "underlies," or "conforms to" the reasoning in the stimulus. Here’s the most consistent method I've found to nail them pretty much every time.

## What Are These Questions Really Asking?

When a question asks you to find a principle to "justify" an argument, it means the author did a half-baked job supporting their conclusion. They gave you some evidence, but they left a logical gap. Your job is to find the answer choice that bridges that gap.

You're looking for a general rule that looks something like this:

> When X condition is met, Y outcome is true.

Here's a couple of my favorites:

> - If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball.
> - Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line.
> - If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.

The correct answer will be a rule like these that connects the evidence given in the stimulus directly to its conclusion.

## The 3-Step Method to Nail These Questions

The harder versions of these questions use complex wording and tempting wrong answers to drain your time. Here’s how I tell students to fight back.

### 1. Organize the Argument

Don't try to analyze the dense paragraph in its original form. Break it down into a simple formula:

**Evidence + Evidence → Conclusion**

Let's use a few common scenarios:

-   **Original:** "The author says we should implement a new policy because it will increase efficiency."
    -   **Simplified:** (1) A policy will increase efficiency → (2) We should implement that policy.
-   **Original:** "The author claims that since the employee worked weekends on the project, she must believe it will succeed."
    -   **Simplified:** (1) An employee works weekends on a project → (2) They must believe the project will be successful.

This makes the argument's structure (and its flaws) much clearer.

### 2. Pre-Phrase the Logical Leap

Now look at your simplified argument and identify the gap. What's missing? What unstated rule does the author assume is true? Your goal is to state that missing rule explicitly. This is your **pre-phrase**.

-   For the efficiency example above, the gap is assuming that increased efficiency is enough reason to implement the policy.
    -   **Pre-phrase:** Whenever an action increases efficiency, it should be done.
-   For the employee example, the gap is assuming that working weekends always comes with a belief in project success.
    -   **Pre-phrase:** If an employee works weekends on something, it means they believe in its likely success.

Trust your pre-phrase! If you find an answer choice that matches it, it’s almost always the correct answer.

### 3. Analyze the Answer Choices Systematically

If your pre-phrase isn't there, don't panic. Analyze each answer choice by asking two simple questions:

1.  **Situation:** Does the situation described in the answer choice match the situation in the stimulus?
2.  **Outcome:** Does the outcome or result in the answer choice match the conclusion of the stimulus?

The correct answer must be a **good match for both**. Wrong answers will mismatch the situation, the outcome, or both.

## Putting It All Together: An Example

Let's walk through an example to see the method in action.

-   **The Stimulus (Simplified):** Some people with good motives deserve less punishment. But motives can be faked, and we can't verify them. Therefore, judges should **never** reduce punishment based on motive.
-   **The Gap:** The author jumps from "motives can be faked" to "we should never act on them." Why? The argument assumes that the risk of accidentally giving less punishment to a liar is **worse** than the certainty of denying deserved leniency to someone with good motives.
-   **My Pre-Phrase:** When you have a choice between two errors, you should choose the path that avoids being too lenient. OR It's better to over-punish than to under-punish.

### Answer Breakdown:

-   **(B) Correct Answer:** "It is better to err on the side of excessive punishment than on the side of leniency."
    -   **Situation:** A choice between two potential errors (over-punishing v. under-punishing). **This matches.**
    -   **Outcome:** Choose excessive punishment (don't mitigate). **This matches the author's conclusion.**
-   **(A) Incorrect:** Discusses laws that permit or prohibit actions.
    -   **Wrong Situation.** The stimulus is about punishment mitigation, not what should be legal.
-   **(C) Incorrect:** Says decisions should be based on consequences, not motives.
    -   **Doesn't bridge the gap.** This doesn't explain why we should ignore motives. It just says we should use something else. It doesn't justify the "never" in the conclusion.
-   **(D) Incorrect:** Discusses the enforceability of laws.
    -   **Wrong Situation.** The stimulus is about applying punishment under existing laws.
-   **(E) Incorrect:** Says to avoid legal systems that could have disastrous consequences.
    -   **Wrong Scope.** "Disastrous" is way too extreme. The stimulus never says the consequences of being lenient would be disastrous, just that it's a risk.

## TL;DR: How to solve 'Principle-Rule' questions

1.  **Simplify** the stimulus into its core components: **Evidence → Conclusion**.
2.  **Find the Gap.** What unstated rule does the author need to make their argument work? **Pre-phrase** this rule.
3.  **Check the Answers.** Find the choice that best matches your pre-phrased rule. It must match both the **situation** and the **outcome** in the stimulus. Eliminate choices that get either one wrong.
