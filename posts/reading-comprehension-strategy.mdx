# LSAT Reading Comprehension: Beyond Just Reading

Reading Comprehension isn't just about reading—it's about strategic analysis under time pressure. Many students struggle here because they approach RC passages like academic reading, but the LSAT requires a fundamentally different approach.

## The Strategic Reading Framework

### Active Passage Mapping
Don't just read; create a mental map:
- **Main Point**: What's the author's central claim?
- **Structure**: How is the argument organized?
- **Tone**: What's the author's attitude?
- **Purpose**: Why was this written?

### The 3-Pass System

**Pass 1: Structure Scan (30 seconds)**
Quickly identify paragraph functions and transitions.

**Pass 2: Content Read (2-3 minutes)**
Read for main ideas and key details, not every word.

**Pass 3: Question Attack (3-4 minutes)**
Use your passage map to efficiently tackle questions.

## Question Type Mastery

### Main Point Questions
Look for thesis statements, conclusions, and purpose indicators.

### Detail Questions
Use paragraph mapping to locate information quickly.

### Inference Questions
Stay conservative—what must be true based on the passage?

### Tone/Attitude Questions
Pay attention to loaded language and evaluative phrases.

## Time Management Secrets

**Difficulty Triage**: Not all passages are created equal. Identify your strengths and attack accordingly.

**Question Order**: Start with main point and detail questions before moving to complex inference questions.

**Elimination Strategy**: Wrong answers often fall into predictable categories—too extreme, unsupported, or out of scope.

## Practice Protocol

1. **Untimed mastery first**: Build accuracy before adding time pressure
2. **Passage type focus**: Master one type (science, humanities, law, social science) at a time
3. **Question pattern recognition**: Study why wrong answers are wrong

The key insight: RC success comes from structured analysis, not just comprehension ability.
