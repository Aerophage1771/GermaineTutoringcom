# You Know Weakeners Should Hurt the Conclusion… But How?  
*(180 Scorer Explains)*

Weaken questions can be stubborn for LSAT students.  
Ask most test-takers what a weakener does and you’ll hear:

> “It hurts the conclusion.”

Fine—**but how?** If you can’t state the typical *mechanisms* behind a weakener, narrowing the answer set on tougher items becomes guesswork.

## A Four-Type Framework

I classify weakeners by **where** the info comes from and **what** it does:

| Type | Source | Effect |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1. **Your Evidence Isn’t Strong** | Premise | Directly attacks the quality of a premise |
| 2. **Your Evidence Fits Another Conclusion** | Premise | Reinterprets the premise to support a different outcome |
| 3. **New Info Hurts Your Conclusion** | Outside the stimulus | Introduces facts that contradict the conclusion |
| 4. **New Info Suggests a Different Conclusion** | Outside the stimulus | Introduces facts that favor an alternative goal/outcome |

### 1. Your Evidence Isn’t Strong (Premise - Attack)

These challenge the **reliability** or **completeness** of the premises.

> “Your proof isn’t good enough.”

*Sampling errors, flawed methods, irrelevant data.*

*Example*:  
“Flexible work hours boost productivity according to a survey of one tech firm.” → The sample is too narrow to justify a general claim.

### 2. Your Evidence Fits Another Conclusion (Premise - Alternative)

Accepts the facts but redirects their meaning.

> “Those same facts could point elsewhere.”

*Misinterpreted correlations, reverse causation.*

*Example*:  
“Restaurants that pay chefs more get better reviews, so paying servers more will help food quality.” → Maybe good food **causes** higher pay, not the reverse.

### 3. New Info Hurts Your Conclusion (Non-Premise - Attack)

Brings in fresh data that contradicts the conclusion without touching the given premises.

*Example*:  
“You project a new train will cut commute times, but recent surveys show residents will keep driving, so traffic won’t drop.”

### 4. New Info Suggests a Different Conclusion (Non-Premise - Alternative)

Adds outside facts that **shift priorities** rather than refute logic.

*Example*:  
“Launching Product X may raise revenue, yet new research shows Product Y would grow faster and profit more—so the smarter move is Y.”

## Why Bother Splitting Hairs?

Sure, LSAT categories blur:

- Sampling errors overlap with part-to-whole flaws.  
- Some label Principle-Justify items differently.  

The point isn’t rigid taxonomy; it’s having a **fallback structure** when a question feels amorphous. Use these four doors to guide your pre-phrase and slash time spent staring at five choices.
