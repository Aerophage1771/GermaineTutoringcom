Weaken questions can be stubborn for LSAT students.
Ask most test-takers what a weakener does and you’ll hear:

> It hurts the conclusion.

Fine—**but how?** If you can’t state the typical *mechanisms* behind a weakener, narrowing the answer set on tougher items becomes guesswork.

## A Four-Type Framework

I classify weakeners by **where** the info comes from and **what** it does:

1.  **Your Evidence Isn’t Strong**
    - **Source:** Premise
    - **Effect:** Directly attacks the quality of a premise

2.  **Your Evidence Fits Another Conclusion**
    - **Source:** Premise
    - **Effect:** Reinterprets the premise to support a different outcome

3.  **New Info Hurts Your Conclusion**
    - **Source:** Outside the stimulus
    - **Effect:** Introduces facts that contradict the conclusion

4.  **New Info Suggests a Different Conclusion**
    - **Source:** Outside the stimulus
    - **Effect:** Introduces facts that favor an alternative goal/outcome

### 1. Your Evidence Isn’t Strong (Premise - Attack)

> Your proof isn’t good enough.

These challenge the **reliability** or **completeness** of the premises. 

**Types:** Pointing out sampling errors, flawed methods, or irrelevant data.

**Example:**

> **Claim:** "You're claiming that more work hours boost productivity according to a survey of one tech firm."
> 
> **Weakener:** "That sample is too narrow to justify a general claim."

### 2. Your Evidence Fits Another Conclusion (Premise - Alternative)

> Those same facts could point elsewhere.

The accept the facts provided but reinterpret their meaning.

**Types:** Switching the direction of causation, posing alternate solutions, choosing different criteria for considering evidence.

**Example:**

> **Claim:** Restaurants that pay chefs more get better reviews, so paying servers more will help food quality.
> 
> **Weakener:** Maybe good food **causes** higher profits and therefore higher pay, not the reverse.

### 3. New Info Hurts Your Conclusion (Non-Premise - Attack)

> You didn't defend against this other problem.

Brings in fresh data that contradicts the conclusion without touching the given premises.

#### Example:

> **Claim:** A new train will cut commute times, so it will help to fix city traffic. 
>
> **Weakener:** Recent surveys show most residents will keep driving, so traffic won’t drop significantly.”

### 4. New Info Suggests a Different Conclusion (Non-Premise - Alternative)

Adds outside facts that **shift priorities** rather than refute logic.

>**Example:**
>
>**Claim:** "Launching Product X may raise revenue, so we should launch it."
>
>**Weakener:** "New research shows Product Y would grow faster and profit more and we can't do both, so the smarter move is Y.”

## Why Bother Splitting Hairs?

Sure, LSAT categories blur:

- Sampling errors overlap with part-to-whole flaws.
- Some label Principle-Justify items differently.

The point isn’t rigid taxonomy; it’s having a **fallback structure** when a question feels amorphous. Use these four doors to guide your pre-phrase and slash time spent staring at five choices.
