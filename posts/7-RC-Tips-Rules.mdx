# 7 Tips for Dealing with the Hardest LSAT Reading Comp Questions

I often preach converting misses into **rules** for future success. Logical Reasoning lends itself to this, but Reading Comp has plenty of rule-worthy patterns too. The tips below draw on PrepTest 106, Section 4, Passage 2 (spoilers ahead) yet remain useful even if you have not read that passage.

---

## Rule 1 – Main Idea Questions

**Two-pass elimination**

1. **Factual check** – Cross out any choice that states info not in the passage.  
2. **Coverage check** – From the survivors, pick the one capturing the widest scope.

*Example (Q6)*  
- (A) and (C) claim the global effect is larger; passage says smaller.  
- (B) misreads the regional effect.  
- (E) botches the reason for overestimation.  
- **(D) wins** – it spans the whole arc: small global effect plus potential large regional effects.

## Rule 2 – Tough Analogy Questions

Use a **two-direction test**.

- **Forward** – Abstract the stimulus; eliminate mismatches.  
- **Reverse** – Abstract a tempting answer; imagine writing a passage to match it. If that passage would differ materially from the real one, dump the choice.

*Example (Q7)*  
Choice (E) maps perfectly: failing to control a hidden cause (immigration) while measuring another (births), mirroring El Niño vs. volcanoes.

---

## Rule 3 – LEAST / EXCEPT Questions

First scan for a **silver-bullet contradiction** – a choice that directly conflicts with the stem’s request.

*Example (Q8, Q12)*  
- Q8: (D) wrongly says El Niño triggers the loop.  
- Q12: (C) claims major eruptions never affect regional temps, contradicting the passage.

---

## Rule 4 – Meaning-in-Context Questions

Pre-phrase the word’s role before reading choices.

*Example (Q9)*  
“Minor” contrasts with “dust-spitting” major eruptions. Best match: an eruption releasing little debris.

---

## Rule 5 – Concept Application

Boil the concept to an abstract rule, then hunt for that pattern.

*Example (Q10)*  
Concept: an amplifying **feedback loop** – X causes more X.  
Choice (A) nails it: more decaying matter → process → still more decaying matter.

---

## Rule 6 – Author’s Agreement Questions

Always anchor your answer to a direct inference or quote, not vibe.

*Example (Q11)*  
Only (C) – major eruptions do not **directly** cause unusually cold summers – is firmly supported by text.

---

## Rule 7 – Paragraph Purpose Questions

Ask, “What would the passage lose if this paragraph vanished?”

*Example (Q13)*  
Final paragraph shows how small global cooling can still yield large regional effects, so the purpose choice must reflect that link. Choice (C) does.

Improving RC at the top end is about ruthless conversion of confusion into clear, reusable rules. Keep drilling, catalog your errors, and watch stubborn misses fade.
