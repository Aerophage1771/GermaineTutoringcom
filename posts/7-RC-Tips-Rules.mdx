I posted recently about analyzing LSAT practice tests and turning incorrect answers into "rules" for the future. While Logical Reasoning lends itself more easily to rule-making, there are still plenty of rules that apply to Reading Comprehension. Here are a few inspired by a specific tough passage, but they are meant to be broadly useful.

## 1. Main Idea Question Approach

For more difficult questions, you can use a two-pass elimination strategy.

**First Pass (Factual Check):** Eliminate any answer that includes information not found in the passage.

**Second Pass (Coverage Check):** Among the remaining factually accurate choices, choose the one that covers the broadest scope. Try to visualize which choice touches more of the key sections and arguments in the text.

> **Example (Q6):**
> - (A) and (C) are factually incorrect. The passage says the global effect is smaller than expected, not larger.
> - (B) is wrong because the regional effect could be larger due to feedback loops, not smaller.
> - (E) misstates the reasoning behind the overestimation.
> - (D) is correct and it covers the full passage arc: Mass and Portman’s finding that the global effect is small (paragraphs 2–3), followed by the possibility of large regional effects via feedback loops (paragraph 4).

## 2. Difficult Analogy Questions

Use a two-directional test if stuck on an Analogy question.

**Forward Direction (Default):** Convert the requested topic into general form and eliminate obvious answer mismatches.

**Reverse Direction:** Abstract a tempting answer’s structure and imagine how it would ideally be presented in the passage. If you were asked to write a passage that matches the answer's analogy, is this the one you would write? If no, consider removing that answer.

> **Example (Q7):**
> The logic in the passage: Mistakenly attributing temperature changes to volcanoes when El Niño was a confounding factor.
>
> **Forward Direction Example:** (A) describes not taking into account "the weight of a package as a whole." This does not match the passage's logic. The analogous error would be failing to account for the weight of the packing material (like El Niño) when trying to determine the weight of the contents (the volcano's effect) from the total weight (full temperature change). Since (A) misidentifies the parts, it can be eliminated.
>
> **Reverse Direction Example:** (D) is a tempting choice. Its abstracted logic is: Failing to remove false data points (false crime reports) from a calculation of a total. Let's reverse this: what would this look like in the passage? It would mean that there was an overstated temperature change, perhaps from a measurement error. This is not the situation in the passage; El Niño's warming is a real, physical phenomenon. It just needs separation from the volcano's warming. Therefore, the logic of (D) does not accurately match the situation.
>
> **(E) is correct.** Its Logic: Failing to control for immigration’s effect on average age while measuring the effect of births. This maps onto the stimulus directly. Both the passage and (E) describe hidden causes confounding an observed effect attributed to another cause.

## 3. LEAST / EXCEPT Questions

In Least / Except questions, try scanning for a "silver bullet" answer first. This is an answer that directly contradicts the request given by the question stem. Often, people default to checking four incorrect answers to eliminate, while there might be a clear option they can select to save time.

> **Example (Q8 and Q12):**
> - **Q8** asks which is not an effect of El Niño. (D) says El Niño initiates the feedback loop. That’s a misattribution. The passage clearly says the volcano’s cooling initiates it.
> - **Q12** asks for the least supported claim. (C) says major eruptions have no effect on regional temps. But the passage explicitly discusses regional effects, especially in the hemisphere of the eruption. It’s a contradiction.

## 4. Meaning in Context Questions

For "Meaning in Context" questions, defeat compelling but incorrect answer choices by pre-phrasing the word's specific function based on the nearby information in the passage. Decide on a meaning before getting swayed by answer choices.

> **Example (Q9):**
> The question asks for the meaning of "minor" in paragraph 3. The passage contrasts "minor eruptions" with "major, dust-spitting explosions." The pre-phrase is: "A 'minor' eruption must be the opposite of a 'dust-spitting' one."
> - (A), (B), and (E) are tempting because they are plausible definitions of "minor." However, they don't capture the specific contrast being made.
> - (D), "an eruption that introduces a relatively small amount of debris into the atmosphere," directly addresses the "dust-spitting" contrast and has the correct contextual meaning.

## 5. Concept Application

When asked to apply a concept, first distill its core function into a simple, abstract rule and trust it. Scan the choices for a good match.

> **Example (Q10):**
> The concept is an amplifying "feedback loop." The distilled rule is: An initial change in variable X triggers a process that results in more of variable X.
> - (B), (C), (D), and (E) all describe complex chains or stabilizing (negative) feedback, where the initial variable is not amplified.
> - (A) is perfect. An increase in "decaying matter" (X) leads to a process that results in "further increases the amount of decaying matter" (more X).

## 6. Author's Agreement Questions

Author’s Agreement questions have an answer that is supported by a clear inference from the passage. Don't take risks. Find a quote or a direct logical step to justify the Author's view you're asserting.

> **Example (Q11):**
> Looking for a hypothesis the author would agree with:
> - (A) is contradicted by M&P's data (0.5°C or less).
> - (B) and (E) are contradicted by the description of El Niño.
> - (D) is contradicted by the "no discernible effect" finding for minor eruptions.
> - (C), "Major volcanic eruptions do not directly cause unusually cold summers," is the best inference. The passage establishes the direct effect as "only half a degree centigrade or less". The "unusually cold summer" scenario is presented as an indirect result of feedback loops.

## 7. Paragraph Purpose Questions

To find a paragraph's purpose, determine its function in relation to the passage's overall argument. Pre-phrase your answer to the question: "Given the whole argument, why did the author add this paragraph here? What would the passage lose if it was removed?"

> **Example (Q13):**
> Purpose of the final paragraph. The passage has just established that the direct global cooling effect is small. The pre-phrase is: This paragraph explains how, despite that small direct effect, the cooling people believe in could still happen.
> - (C): "explain how regional climatic conditions can be significantly affected by a small drop in temperature." This perfectly matches the pre-phrase.

The better you can get at the process of efficiently converting the issues you encounter on the LSAT into rules for future questions, the easier you will find it to clear away those issues and advance to the score you're seeking.
