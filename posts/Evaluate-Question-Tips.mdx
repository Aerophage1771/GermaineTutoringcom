I spent today knocking out every available Evaluate question I could find. Each one asks some version of, “What extra information would really help you judge this argument’s validity?” After working through them, a few patterns stood out that will help you cut through surface-level relevance and zero in on what matters. Here’s what I noticed.

## 1. Use the Two-Outcome Test

Evaluate questions boil down to this: you have an invalid argument, and you need extra knowledge that would either move it closer to validity or let you rule it out entirely.

Because of that, a correct answer almost always provides two clear points of confirmation. When the issue is binary (yes versus no) compare the two answers and see whether they shift the argument in opposite directions.

> - Are clouds a good indicator of rain coming? **Yes?** Bring the umbrella. **No?** Maybe leave it.
> - Do you mind getting soaked without an umbrella? **Yes?** Bring it. **No?** You can do without then.
> - Do you consider carrying an umbrella an annoyance? **Yes?** Maybe ditch it. **No?** More reason to bring it.

This makes it pretty straightforward to compare possible outcomes to find the correct answer. The right answer will always leave you feeling more confident in the argument in one direction and less confident in the other.

## 2. More than Two Answers? Check the Extremes

Some Evaluate questions skip a simple yes/no setup and instead offer percentages, likelihoods, or financial values. In those cases, push the answer choice to its extremes and see what happens to the conclusion. For a percentage, imagine 0 percent versus 100 percent. For profits, try a penny versus a trillion dollars. If one extreme makes the claim a lot stronger (or weaker), that answer is probably right.

Another quick check: ask, “If I were the author, would I care whether this number went up or down?” If the conclusion hinges on that shift, keep the option; if it doesn’t, reject it even if it sounds on-topic.

## 3. When the Wrong Answer Sounds Right

Top-tier wrong answers usually stay on topic but introduce a detail that doesn’t actually affect the conclusion. They seem relevant on the surface but fail the two-outcome test. They don’t really shift the argument depending on how they’re answered.

Say you're evaluating whether to buy a product, and the tempting wrong answer compares its current price to what it used to cost. That’s loosely connected to the topic, but it doesn't inform whether the item is worth buying now, based on its present features and tradeoffs.

Or you're assessing whether a new technology can solve an environmental problem. The incorrect answer mentions surprise fees. That would matter if the argument were about cost-effectiveness or overall practicality, but not when the core claim is about technical feasibility.

To rule these out, apply the same method used to find the right answer: step into the author’s mindset, consider the different ways the answer might play out, and ask whether the argument’s conclusion would genuinely shift based on those outcomes. If not, it’s a decoy.

## 4. If You’re Really Stuck: Invert

You’re facing a tough question at the highest difficulty and nothing is working. You’ve tried the binary test, checked the extremes, and ruled out connections that do not actually affect the argument. Still stuck? Try inverting.

Flip your perspective. Take the answer choice and ask yourself: If you were writing an LSAT stimulus designed to make this the correct answer, would it look like the one in front of you? Or does the answer just sort of fit, while a different argument would fit it even better?

If one option feels like a perfect match and the other only loosely fits, go with the one that matches cleanly. That close-but-not-quite answer might feel relevant but usually belongs to a different claim or addresses a side issue. Your brain is likely picking up on a subtle mismatch even if you cannot fully explain it. And in a timed section, that instinct matters.

(This method works especially well for high scorers with strong intuition. Even leaning 60–40 toward an answer can result in 80 to 90 percent accuracy, because the majority of LSAT correct answers are flawless. A small disconnect often signals a deeper flaw, even if you do not have time to track it down fully.)

## 5. Applying Evaluate Skills to Other Question Types

Evaluate questions serve as the bridge between flaw and strengthen/weaken questions. Oftentimes, when students have trouble prephrasing strengthen and weaken answers, I’ll back them up to evaluate questions to work through the skill of thinking through what the possible avenues for strengthening and weakening are. Once you know what information you can supplement your arguments with to change their validity, it becomes much easier to do so on a difficult strengthen problem.

The most common evaluate answer type identifies or rules out the presence of alternative causes. Guess what a very common strengthen answer does? Rules out causes that compete with the author's asserted cause. One of the most common weakeners? Poses alternative causation to rival the argument’s claim.

The same is true of validating sampling methods, defining ambiguous terminology, verifying the quality of analogies, and other common methods of evaluating arguments. So invest the time learning these techniques. The better you get at thinking of ways to evaluate an argument in the abstract, the easier it’ll be to call them from memory on other question types later on.
