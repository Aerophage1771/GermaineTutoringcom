# Five Insights After Solving All 31 Released Evaluate Questions

Evaluate questions ask, **“What extra fact would let you judge this argument’s validity?”**  
I ran every released item and noticed five patterns that will keep you from chasing on-topic, yet useless, details.

## 1. Run the Two-Outcome Test

A correct Evaluate answer offers **two clear directions**: one outcome boosts confidence in the conclusion, the opposite outcome sinks it.

> **Example**  
> Are clouds a good indicator of rain?  
> - **Yes** – you pack an umbrella.  
> - **No** – you leave it home.  
> Either way, the answer moves the decision.

If an answer does not flip the argument when you toggle its outcomes, cross it out.

## 2. When Values Vary, Push the Extremes

Some items give ranges or percentages instead of yes-or-no.  
Push the value to **0 vs. 100** or **penny vs. billion** and watch the conclusion:

- If one extreme makes the claim much stronger or weaker, the answer is promising.  
- Ask: **“Would the author care if this number changes?”** If the conclusion survives any swing, reject the choice.

## 3. Spot the “Relevant but Useless” Decoy

Tempting wrong answers stay on topic yet fail the two-outcome test. They add trivia the author would not care about.

- Comparing today’s price to last year when the decision is about current value.  
- Mentioning surprise fees in a claim that hinges only on technical feasibility.

Step into the author’s shoes. If the conclusion would not budge, dump the answer.

## 4. Stuck? Invert Your View

Visualize writing a stimulus that *needs* a given answer to evaluate it.

- Does the current argument match that ideal?  
- If another answer fits much more cleanly, pick it.  
- Trust slight “fit” instincts – the LSAT’s correct answers are airtight, near misses rarely win.

## 5. Leverage Evaluate Skills Elsewhere

Evaluate bridges flaw and strengthen/weaken tasks:

- **Strengthen** – often rules out alternative causes the Evaluate answer highlighted.  
- **Weaken** – often introduces the rival cause Evaluate revealed.  
- The same applies to sampling, ambiguity, and analogy quality.

Master thinking of what information would shift validity, and tougher strengthen or weaken items get easier.
