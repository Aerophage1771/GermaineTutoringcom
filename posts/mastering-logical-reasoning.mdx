Far too often I see students here saying some variation of: "There are just some questions that are ambiguous and there's not much you can do about it."

And that claim comes in multiple formats:

> - “You need outside knowledge.”
> - “There’s no consistent framework on the test.”
> - “Multiple answers could be true.”
> - “The stimulus isn’t enough to choose an option.”
> - “The RC passage is vague in some vital portion.”

## Nonsense

Every single LSAT question has exactly one plausibly correct answer. Either the correct answer is unambiguously right, the incorrect answers are clearly wrong, or (usually) both.

Now, if people want to argue that some questions are worded poorly or could be clearer, I get that. There are definitely some that suck.

PT106-S1-Q25? Thank goodness that didn’t become a recurring question type. But is there any doubt which answer is right? Absolutely not.

I recently saw a thread where someone asked how to start zeroing their LR, and the only comment said: “The LSAT isn’t consistent, so it’s not possible. There isn’t a strong internal logic to it…”

Sorry, but no. The LSAT can be frustrating, but I was hitting -0 on about 90% of LR sections at the end of my practice and 50-50 between -0/-1 for RC. I’ve been tutoring for five years, and I’ve had multiple students consistently score -0 or -1 on either or both sections.

What you need to do is sit down and humbly drill into the flaws in your process. Take an untimed section. Record yourself talking through each question. Then review what you missed or couldn’t explain. Check explanations. Ask for feedback. Convert your errors into concrete rules for next time.

If you’re missing a question, it means you made a diagnosable mistake. Stop telling yourself you're just getting screwed by the test. You’re screwing yourself by not accepting that this test can be crushed if you commit to the work.

So go do the damn work.

Tear apart every question you miss until you understand exactly what went wrong. Then use those pieces to build your path to your target score.

Is that boring? Yeah.

Tedious? As hell.

But do you want to go to your dream law school? Yes? Then this is how you give yourself a shot.

There are few things more rewarding as a tutor than watching a student claw their way to destroying their goal score, then getting a text months later saying they got into Harvard, UVA, NYU, or landed a full ride somewhere. That’s the stuff that gets me up in the morning. That’s how I know I’m making a difference.

So if that fires me up—and I’m years past taking this test—it damn well better light a fire under you. Go get that dream score!
