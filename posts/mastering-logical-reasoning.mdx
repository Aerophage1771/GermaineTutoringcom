# The #1 Worst Lie LSAT Students Tell Themselves  
*(View of a 180 Scorer)*

Far too often I see students say some variation of:

> “There are just some questions that are ambiguous, and there’s not much you can do about it.”

Common versions:

- “You need outside knowledge.”  
- “There’s no consistent framework on the test.”  
- “Multiple answers could be true.”  
- “The stimulus isn’t enough to choose an option.”  
- “The RC passage is vague in some vital portion.”

**Nonsense.**

Every single LSAT question from PT101 through PT158 has exactly one plausibly correct answer. Either the right choice is unambiguously correct, the wrong ones are clearly wrong, or both.

If someone wants to argue that a question’s wording could be clearer, fine. Some items do stink—PT106-S1-Q25 still makes me cringe—but does anyone doubt which answer is right? Absolutely not.

I recently saw a thread where someone asked how to start zeroing out LR. The only reply claimed:

> “The LSAT isn’t consistent, so it’s impossible. There isn’t a strong internal logic…”

Sorry, but no. As my prep wrapped up I was hitting –0 on about 90 % of LR sections and flipping between –0/–1 in RC. After five years of tutoring, I’ve seen multiple students lock in the same consistency.

## What To Do Instead

1. **Own your process errors**  
   Take an untimed section. Record yourself explaining every choice.

2. **Review aggressively**  
   For each miss or uncertain pick, study official explanations, discuss with peers, and pinpoint the rule you ignored.

3. **Build a rulebook**  
   Convert each mistake into a concrete principle so you never repeat it.

If you’re missing a question, you made a diagnosable mistake. Stop telling yourself the test is screwing you. You’re screwing yourself by refusing to accept that this exam can be crushed if you commit to the work.

### Yes, It’s Boring—and Necessary

Tearing apart every error is tedious. Do it anyway. This grind is what gets students into Harvard, UVA, NYU, or a full-ride elsewhere. Watching someone claw to their dream score then text me their acceptance never gets old; it should fire you up even more.

So go do the work. Tear apart each miss, learn the lesson, and build your path to the score that changes your future.
