      <p>Far too often I see students here saying some variation of: "There are just some questions that are ambiguous and there's not much you can do about it." And that claim comes in multiple formats: "You need outside knowledge," or "There's no consistent framework on the test."</p>
      
      <h2>Nonsense</h2>
      <p>Every single LSAT question has exactly one plausibly correct answer. Either the correct answer is unambiguously right, the incorrect answers are clearly wrong, or (usually) both. Now, if people want to argue that some questions are worded poorly or could be clearer, I get that. There are definitely some that suck.</p>
      
      <p>I recently saw a thread where someone asked how to start zeroing their LR, and the only comment said: "The LSAT isn't consistent, so it's not possible. There isn't a strong internal logic to it…" Sorry, but no.</p>
      
      <p>The LSAT can be frustrating, but I was hitting -0 on about 90% of LR sections at the end of my practice. I've been tutoring for five years, and I've had multiple students consistently score -0 or -1. What you need to do is sit down and humbly drill into the flaws in your process.</p>
      
      <p>Take an untimed section. Record yourself talking through each question. Then review what you missed or couldn't explain. Check explanations. Ask for feedback. Convert your errors into concrete rules for next time.</p>
      
      <p>Stop telling yourself you're just getting screwed by the test. You're screwing yourself by not accepting that this test can be crushed if you commit to the work. So go do the damn work.</p>
