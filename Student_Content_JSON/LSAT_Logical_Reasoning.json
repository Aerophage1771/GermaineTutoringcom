The correct answer acts as a \"bridge,\" explicitly connecting these two ideas in a way the author assumed but did not state. Test-takers often miss these because the answer choice can look like a new, unrelated premise. For example, if the premise is about cost and the conclusion is about social status, the strengthener will provide a rule or a fact that links cost to social status."

A phrase like \"All dogs are mammals\" creates a 100% certain relationship (Dog -> Mammal): if you have a dog, you definitely have a mammal. However, LSAT arguments rarely offer this level of certainty. More often, arguments rely on quantifiers—words like \"most\" or \"some\"—that express partial truths.

The stimulus says NG alloys superconduct at temperatures \"no higher than -160.\" This means -160 or lower (e.g., -170, -200). It does NOT mean they stop working below -160. They could work perfectly well at -273. We only know they don't work above -160.\n\n**(E) INCORRECT.** This answer choice is TOO BROAD.
